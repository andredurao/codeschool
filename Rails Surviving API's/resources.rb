A resource is a conceptual mapping to a set of entities, 
not the entity that corresponds to the mapping at any particular point in time. - Steve Klaknik


GET
# => Safe - it should not take any action other than retrieval
# => Idempotent - sequential GET requests to the same URI should not generate side-effects
